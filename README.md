# venv shortcut (for Windows)
## Installation
- Simply put these two batch scritps somewhere in PATH.
- If you don't want to add a new directory to PATH, just drag them to `C:\Windows`.

## Usage
Now you can just...
- Type `venv` in your terminal instead of `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual enviroment.
- You can also use `venv myprojectname` instead of `python -m venv myprojectname`.
- Enable a virtual enviroment with `-a` (`venv -a` / `venv -a myprojectname`).
- Exit the active virtual enviroment with `venv -d` or just `d` (without having to type venv).
