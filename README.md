# venv shortcut (for Windows)
## Installation
- Simply put these two batch scritps somewhere in PATH.
- If you don't want to add a new directory to PATH, just drag them to `C:\Windows`,<br> `C:\Python313\Scripts` or wherever your `pip.exe` is.

## Usage
Now you can just...
- Type `venv` in your terminal instead of `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual enviroment.
- You can also use `venv myprojectname` instead of `python -m venv myprojectname`.
- Enable a virtual enviroment with `a.venv` (or `a.venv name` if it's not called "venv").
- Exit the active virtual enviroment with `d.venv` as short alternative for `deactivate`.
